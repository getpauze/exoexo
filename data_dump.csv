HD-17156-b,"images/HD-17156-b.png","It is a gas giant. Highly elliptical orbit. significantly closer to its star",False,"It is hot  with extreme temperatures and a gaseous composition, lacking a solid surface and having a hostile atmosphere, making it unsuitable for habitability."
GJ-1132-b,"images/GJ-1132-b.png","Rocky world a little bigger than Earth. May have lost one atmosphere but gained another from volcanic activity. Atmosphere composed of hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen cyanide",False,"It has a toxic atmosphere, making it inhospitable for life."
TrES-2-b,"images/TrES-2-b.png","Darkest planet ever discovered, less reflective than coal. It is a gas giant. Possible deep red glow from burning atmosphere",False,"TrES-2 b, known as the 'Eternal Night' planet, is a gas giant with extreme temperatures around 2,000째F and a light-absorbing atmosphere, lacking a solid surface, making it inhospitable for life."
Kepler-186f,"images/Kepler-186-f.png","Radius about 1.11 times Earth's. Orbits its star every 129.9 days.Temperature between -148째F and -94째F. Gas giant like Saturn",False,"Without a substantial greenhouse effect, Kepler-186f could be too cold for liquid water to exist on its surface."
Kepler-36-b,"images/Kepler-36-b.png","Close to its host star. Temperature around 1,300째F. Hot, rocky planet",False,"Kepler-36b's proximity to its star and another planet results in high temperatures and unstable atmospheric conditions, making it inhospitable."
