KELT-9-b,"images/KELT-9-b.png","Gas giant, 2.88 times the mass of Jupiter but only half as dense. Orbits its star every 1.5 Earth days. Temperature reaches over 7,800°F",False,"It's so hot that molecules like water and carbon dioxide cannot exist in its atmosphere."
PSR-B1257+12-b,"images/PSR-B1257+12-b.png","Mass is 2% of Earth's. Rotates at about 161 times per second. Orbits a pulsar - star that emits high levels of radiation",False,"The intense radiation environment makes it impossible for life as we know it to exist on this planet."
K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb,"images/K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb.png","Its a gaseous giant. Mass and distance from its sun similar to Jupiter. Takes 12.9 years to orbit its star",False,"It is a gas giant with no solid surface and is located far from its star, resulting in cold temperatures and low energy availability, making it likely inhospitable for life."
Kepler-452-b,"images/Kepler-452-b.png","It orbits a star similar to our Sun, with an orbital period of 384.8 days. Temperature is 17°F. It is 60% larger than Earth and likely has a rocky surface. The environment has high gravity",True,"The temperature and distance make it possible for water to exist its surface."
