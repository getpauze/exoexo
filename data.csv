Kepler-452-b,"images/Kepler-452-b.png","It orbits a star similar to our Sun. The temperature is such that it's not too hot or too cold for liquid water to exist on its surface. It is 60% larger than Earth. The planet receives slightly more energy from its star than Earth does. It has a rocky surface. The environment has high gravity.",True,"The exoplanet is in the habitable zone of its star, Kepler-452, allowing for potential liquid water. It is 1.5 times the size of Earth and orbits a Sun-like star that is 1.5 billion years older, suggesting more time for atmospheric and life development, making it a strong candidate for habitability."
Kepler-186f,"images/Kepler-186f.png","Two suns set over horizon. Temperature between -148°F and -94°F. Gas giant like Saturn.",False,"Kepler-186f's M-dwarf star may strip its atmosphere with flares and its larger size raises questions about surface conditions."
KELT-9b,"images/KELT-9b.png","Hotter than most stars. Temperature reaches over 7,800°F. Gas giant planet. Orbits very close to its host star",False,"KELT-9b's extreme temperatures and proximity to its hot A-type star create hostile conditions unsuitable for life."
Kepler-36-b,"images/Kepler-36-b.png","Close to its host star. Temperature around 1,300°F. Hot, rocky planet",False,"Kepler-36b's proximity to its star and another planet results in high temperatures and unstable atmospheric conditions, making it inhospitable."
PSR-B1257+12-b,"images/PSR-B1257+12-b.png","Orbits a pulsar emitting high levels of radiation. First exoplanet discovered 2,300 light-years away. Rotates at about 161 times per second.",False,"PSR B1257+12 b orbits a pulsar, exposing it to intense radiation and unstable conditions, making it inhospitable for life."
K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb,"images/K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb.png","Gas giant exoplanet similar to Jupiter. Mass and distance from its sun similar to Jupiter. Takes 12.9 years to orbit its star.",False,"K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb is a gas giant with no solid surface and is located far from its star, resulting in cold temperatures and low energy availability, making it inhospitable for life."
HD-17156-b,"images/HD-17156-b.png","It is a gas giant. Highly elliptical orbit. significantly closer to its star.",False,"It is hot  with extreme temperatures and a gaseous composition, lacking a solid surface and having a hostile atmosphere, making it unsuitable for habitability."
GJ-1132-b,"images/GJ-1132-b.png","Rocky world a little bigger than Earth. May have lost one atmosphere but gained another from volcanic activity. Atmosphere composed of hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen cyanide",False,"It has a toxic atmosphere, making it inhospitable for life."
TrES-2-b,"images/TrES-2-b.png","Darkest planet ever discovered, less reflective than coal. It is a gas giant. Possible deep red glow from burning atmosphere",False,"TrES-2 b, known as the 'Eternal Night' planet, is a gas giant with extreme temperatures around 2,000°F and a light-absorbing atmosphere, lacking a solid surface, making it inhospitable for life."
